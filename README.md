# Inkscape markers

A set of custom markers (mostly arrows) for Inkscape.  These markers
were procured from various sources (see the comments in the SVG files in
the `src` directory), were converted to Inkscape markers using the
technique described in [this video][1] and cleaned up using [Scour][2].

## Usage

Copy/merge the contents of the file `markers.svg` to the global markers
file used by Inkscape located at:

    /usr/share/inkscape/markers/markers.svg     # GNU/Linux
    ...\Program Files\Inkscape\share\markers    # Windows

Note that the `markers.svg` file of this repository does not have all
the default markers that Inkscape comes with, thus merge the two files
if necessary.
